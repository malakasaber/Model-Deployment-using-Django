## Machine Learning Models

### XGBoost

- **Purpose:** Gradient boosting framework optimized for speed and performance
- **Strengths:** High accuracy, handles missing data, effective on structured data
- **Use Case:** Predicts fares with fine-grained performance tuning and scalability

### Linear Regression

- **Purpose:** Models linear relationship between input variables and output
- **Strengths:** Fast, interpretable, works well with linearly correlated data
- **Use Case:** Predicts fares based on distance when the relationship is linear

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Purpose:** Instance-based learning model for classification and regression
- **Strengths:** Simple, non-parametric, adapts well to local data structure
- **Use Case:** Estimates fares by comparing with similar past trips

### Ridge Regression

- **Purpose**: Linear regression with L2 regularization
- **Strengths**: Good for handling multicollinearity, stable predictions
- **Use Case**: Baseline model for fare prediction

### Decision Tree

- **Purpose**: Non-linear tree-based regression model
- **Strengths**: Captures complex patterns, easy to interpret
- **Use Case**: Handles non-linear relationships in fare calculation
